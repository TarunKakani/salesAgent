/**
 * Sales Dataset Agentic AI Prototype
 *
 * This is the initial working prototype of an agentic AI designed to analyze sales datasets
 * using the open source model Phi-3-mini-4k. The project demonstrates the integration of
 * an open source language model to create an intelligent agent capable of basic dataset analysis.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Utilizes Phi-3-mini-4k as the core AI model.
 * - Designed for sales dataset analysis.
 * - Serves as a foundation for further development and enhancements.
 *
 * Future Plans:
 * - Deep analysis capabilities for sales data.
 * - Generation of visualizations and pictures based on dataset insights.
 * - Fine-tuning the model specifically for the sales dataset to improve accuracy and relevance.
 *
 * Note: This is the first version and a proof-of-concept. The project will be expanded with
 * more advanced features and improved AI capabilities in future iterations.
